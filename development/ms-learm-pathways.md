**Prerequisites**:
- [First steps with C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/csharp-first-steps/) 
- [First steps with Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/python-first-steps/)
- AI capabilities on Azure, [Azure AI Fundamentals certification](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals)

## DP-100 Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure
The Azure Data Scientist applies their knowledge of data science and machine learning to implementing and running machine learning workloads on Microsoft Azure; in particular, using Azure Machine Learning Service. This entails planning and creating a suitable working environment for data science workloads on Azure, running data experiments and training predictive models, managing and optimizing models, and deploying machine learning models into production.

## AI-050 Develop Generative AI Solutions with Azure OpenAI Service
Azure OpenAI Service provides access to OpenAI's powerful large language models such as GPT; the model behind the popular ChatGPT service. These models enable various natural language processing (NLP) solutions to understand, converse, and generate content. Users can access the service through REST APIs, SDKs, and Azure OpenAI Studio. Course will cover on how to provision Azure OpenAI service, deploy models, and use them in generative AI applications.
