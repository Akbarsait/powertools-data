## Azure architecture and Azure compute services
  - Azure resources are components like storage, virtual machines, and networks that are available to build cloud solutions.
 - Resource Groups: A container to manage and aggregate resources in a single unit. Permission applied to RG applied to all resources contained in it. 
  ![RG](/assets/azure/6resourcegroups.png)

 - Azure Subscriptions provides authorization and authentication access to Azure accounts. 
    ![AS](/assets/azure/7azuresubscriptions.png)
    - Azure AD account is required to manage a subscription. 
    - Only one account admin is allowed. 
    - Merging of two subscriptions into a single is unallowed.

 - Management Groups can include multiple azure subscriptions.![MG](/assets/azure/8managementgroups.png)
   - Subscriptions inherit conditions applied to MG. 

 - Availability Zones: 
   - Physically separte locations within an Azure region. 
   - Each AZ consists of one or more datacenters equipped with inddependent power, cooling and networking. 
   - if one AZ down, the other continue to work
   - Not all Azure regions support availabilty zones. 
   - AZ are different physical locations and will continue to work if the original data center fails.
   - AZ can be used to replicate data within the same region. 
 - Availabity Set protects Azure resources from failures within data center.
